# Web Structure Modelling

A Python-based project to create 3D web structures according to user specifications for use with OpenSCAD. All output is saved to clipboard. 

- **sw.py** can create spiral models with 3 modes of spiral spacing (More realistic)
- **concentric.py** can create concentric models with all 3 modes of spiral spacing. (Deprecated. sw.py has been completed, and concentric.py only remains here as a record of past work)
